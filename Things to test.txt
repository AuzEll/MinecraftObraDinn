Things to test:

Sigma Test Build (chs 2, 6 & 1)
Prev. Build (chs 10, 7, 9 & 3)

Functionality:
This build is mainly for testing the new chapters, the Hall of Identities and the clickable commands in the Main Journal.
This build is set from the start so you will have to go through some of the same memories again to get to the Orlop Deck.
You can ignore testing the previously tested memories if you wish.

Fastest route to Orlop Deck (using roman numeral of 'chapter' + number of 'part' to represent memory):
X1 -> X2 -> X3 -> (Captain's bed) VII8 -> VII7 -> VII6 -> (Midshipmen cabin) IX6 to IX1

There's only 3 clickable commands and it shouldn't be too difficult to see if they work or not.
One of them teleports you to the Hall of Identities. Importantly, upon leaving the HOI you should be teleported back to whatever memory you were in when you clicked the command. If you were on the ship, you will be teleported to the main deck, by the starboard ladder.
Trying to teleport to the HOI should only not work while you're watching a cutscene.
In the HOI a sign should spawn below a character portrait after you've visited the memory where they perished/disappeared, detailing the memory in question and providing a number of total appearances throughout the game, and one should spawn above the portrait (replacing the bamboo one) stating their full name and quality after you have solved that person's identity and fate.

- Once again, test the 'new memory' system of each memory.
- Make sure skipping the cutscene DOESN'T work on first visit of a memory and that it DOES on subsequent visits (make sure to grab the book from every memory as this is how the game detects if you've visited it before).
- Make sure a sign spawns on the command block on the ship after first time visiting the memories.
- Make sure new command blocks are spawning whenever the game tells you "A new memory is available...".
- Try to solve the fates of the victims in the new memories to test if all that is working for the new books

Honestly if anything seems like it's broken or not quite working as intended just DM me.

Progression:
- Upon arriving at the Orlop Deck, both trapdoors leading to the Cargo Deck should be locked.
- A Bitter Cold part 3 leads to part 2 -> leads to part 1. (remember whenever all parts of a chapter have been visited and you've returned to the ship, a message will appear on the screen saying so)
- Soldiers of the Sea part 7 leads to part 6 -> leads to part 5 -> leads to part 4.
- Exiting SotS part 5 should open the trapdoor leading from Orlop to Cargo deck and the one from Orlop to Gun deck.
- Soldiers of the Sea part 3 leads to part 2 -> leads to part 1.
- Soldiers of the Sea part 8 is located in the Bosun's store (starboard side) on the Cargo Deck.
- Loose Cargo part 2 (Bosun's store port side) leads to part 1
